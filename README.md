fencai.vim
==========

A vim colorscheme with pastel colors inspired by
traditional Chinese Fěncǎi (粉彩 Famille Rose) porcelain.

## Intallation

Use your favorite plugin manager
or copy `fencai.vim` into your `{runtimepath}/colors/`

## Note

This is the first ever and only vim colorscheme
that fully support [Hy](https://github.com/hylang/hy).

I code in Hy and OCaml using GVim most of the time lately,
so fencai works best with Hy and OCaml in GUI,
supports for others may come later.
